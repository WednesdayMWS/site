# Custom Music

## Prerequisites
:::note
You do not require Unreal Engine to be installed to replace the game's audio
:::
 - Wwise 2021.1.13.8036 **or** [wwise_pd3](https://github.com/MoolahModding/wwise_pd3/releases/latest)
 - A program that can extract UE4 PAK files (FModel, UModel)
 - A program that can pack UE4 PAK files (repak, UnrealPak)

## Setting up your sound files
In order for Wwise and wwise_pd3 to work properly, your files must be
in the WAV format with PCM encoding. The best way to do this is to use
a tool like ffmpeg to encode your audio to little endian 16-bit.

An example command for this is `ffmpeg -i input.wav/mp3 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav`

## Encoding your files for PAYDAY 3

### Using Wwise
1. Make sure you have a Wwise project made for converting all
your audio files.

:::warning
Your Wwise project must have its Conversion Settings set to `PCM Auto Detect High`
before you import any files. Or they will not play in PAYDAY 3.

You can set this by opening the project settings (Project->Project Settings),
going to the Source Settings tab. Pressing the 3 dots next to the
currently set conversion setting and selecting
`Factory Conversion Settings -> PCM -> PCM Auto Detect High`
:::

2. Import your audio files using the "Import Audio Files..." option in the project menu or
use Shift+I when in the project.

3. Once you open the audio importer, you will need add your files using
the "Add Files..." button.

4. Once you've selected your files, press the "Import" button and wait
for it to finish importing.
5. Once complete, save your Wwise project and press the "Convert All Audio Files...".
6. Once the Audio File Conversion window is open, press the "Convert"
button at the bottom of the window.
7. Once the audio files have finished converting, the WEM files will be
in `{WwiseProjectFolder}/.cache/Windows/SFX`. Once you've located them,
you can continue to the [Adding your converted files to PAYDAY 3](#adding-your-converted-files-to-payday-3)
section of this guide

### Using wwise_pd3
:::note
At the moment, voice line encoding is supported, voice line decoding is not.
:::

1. Open a command prompt window in the folder your
WAV files are in.
2. Use the command `wwise_pd3 -encode input.wav output.wem`
3. Your WEM file will be located where you specified the output file to go
4. You can now continue to the [Adding your converted files to PAYDAY 3](#adding-your-converted-files-to-payday-3)
section of this guide

## Adding your converted files to PAYDAY 3
Once you have your encoded Wwise file, you will first
need to find the file you are trying to replace
in PAYDAY 3's game files.

If you are struggling to find the one you want to replace,
you can use the [map of Names to Ids](#wwise-ids-currently-used-by-the-games-soundtrack).

Once you've found the one you want to replace, open your preferred
PAK explorer, like FModel, and navigate to `PAYDAY3/Content/WwiseAudio/Media`.
Once there, search for the file id you want to replace and extract it.

Once extracted, you will need 3 files: `{Id}.uasset`, `{Id}.ubulk` and `{Id}.uexp`,
copy these files to your mod's `PAYDAY3/Content/WwiseAudio/Media` folder.

Before deleting or modifying any files, please note the `Size` value
of the ubulk file in the Windows properties window, particularly the size in bytes
as you will need it later

![Windows Properties UBulk](assets/windows-properties-ubulk.png)

Now, you can delete the ubulk from the game and rename your wem file to have the same name,
including the extension.

:::note
TODO: Write a script that modifies the uexp for you
:::

If you package it like this, it will play for a moment in the game, but will quickly
turn to loud static. To fix this issue, open the .uexp file you extracted in a hex editor.
And find the size in bytes you noted earlier, convert it to hex, and find it in the uexp file within the hex editor. It should
occur twice. Now, get the size in bytes of your replacement ubulk and convert that into hex,
and change both occurrences to the size of your new file.

Once done, save and repackage your mod, and you'll find your audio replacement plays properly.
